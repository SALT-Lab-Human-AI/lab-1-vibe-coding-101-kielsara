# Comparison of VSCode + Github Copilot and Gemini CLI for a Simple Ping-Pong Game

## 1. Code Quality

*    Both AI tools use similar variable naming conventions and followed a very similar code structure, first defining variables and then working through the game process and logistics. However, I felt as though the file generated by VSCode + Github Copilot did a better job at clarifiying and separating out blocks of code.
*    VSCode + Copilot Github separated out the ``draw()`` logic from the ``main()`` function, which I feel contributes well to maintainability in that future changes can be made more quickly. The Gemini CLI file uses global variables, which are not recommended for code efficiency or maintainability due to unintended side effects.
*    Performance effiency between the two tools is fairly comparable. They are both set to run at 60 FPS and there isn't any strenuous functions or code structures being used that would cause long run times.
*    Both tools could have incorporated docstrings for more clarity. 

## 2. Speed of Generation

*   I believe Gemini CLI generated its file slightly faster, without considering the breaks it took to ask for my permission to perform steps.

## 3. Ease of Use

*   Both tools didn't take too long to understand and jump into. I had used VSCode previously, and Gemini CLI is just running in my terminal which I was familiar with as well. I do believe Gemini CLI was a bit more user-friendly, though. Although I had used VSCode before, it took me a minute to understand the setup of the Github Copilot extension, as it changes the standard VSCode layout. 

## 4. Debugging and Error Handling

*   After each file was ran, VSCode + Github Copilot would stop and not prompt me when an error occurred. I would have to read the error messages like usual and debug on my own, although I could ask Copilot Chat for assistance. When Gemini CLI ran its file, it tried fixing any errors that occurred on its own, and was successfully able to do so without needing to prompt me, although it would notify me of error messages that popped up. I am not sure of what would happen if Gemini CLI was not able to solve an error message that popped up.

## 5. Flexibility and Customization

*   Unless I am missing something, it seems more difficult to edit the provided code in VSCode + Github Copilot once the initial code has been accepted. I can ask Copilot Chat to provide me with the necessary edited code, but I would then have to copy and paste it in myself. With Gemini CLI, it'll automatically make the necessary edits in the file for me.

## 6. Conclusion

*   Overall, I am conflicted as to which tool I liked most. I like that VSCode + Github Copilot allows me to see the full code file thanks to the VSCode interface. However, it was also nice to see more of the AI's thought process with Gemini CLI, and that it prompted me throughout without me asking it to. VSCode + Github Copilot had slightly better code in terms of readability, clarity, and structure. Interestingly, despite using the same prompt with both tools, Gemini CLI created a game where the player went against AI, while VSCode + Github Copilot created a two human player game.
